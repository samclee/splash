# Step 1, you HAVE to define symbols for Hao Yu and Davonte
define h "Hao Yu" left
define d "Davonte" right

# Step 2, to show a sprite, you use "show <symbol> <emotion name>"
# The 5 emotion names are smile, neutral, flirty, angry, surprised
# You can add blush and paint by adding them to the end, ex: "smileblush", "neutralpaint", "angryblushpaint" <- it has to be "blushpaint" and not "paintblush"
show h smileblush

# Step 3 to have them speak, you use their symbol and then a quoted line
h "Bleep bloop"
