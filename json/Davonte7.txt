d "(Okay. Here we go, Thompson.)"

show d neutralpaint
d "Listen."

d "We’ve been friends a long time. Ever since elementary school —"

show h angrypaint
h "Correction: rivals. We’ve been rivals a long time."

show d smilepaint

show d smileblushpaint
d "You’ve always been such a passionate and stubborn person who never gave up until he got what he wanted."

show h surprisedpaint

show d neutralpaint
d "You’re forward, aggressive, and honest in all the ways that I couldn’t be."

d "And I think that’s amazing — to live your life without caring about all of the bullshit others sling at you."

show h surprisedpaint

show d angrypaint
d "Focus!"

h "Okay, okay. Sheesh."

show d smilepaint
d "(He’s too easy to read.)"

d "Hao Yu, take me on a date."

d "Next Saturday. I want you to plan it out meticulously from start to finish."

d "I don’t care where we go, what we eat, or how long you keep me up."

show d flirtypaint
d "I just want you to be mine for an entire day."

show h neutralpaint

show h surprisedpaint
h "...Really?"

show d surprisedpaint
d "Oh."

d "Well, I mean... if you’re seriously against the idea, then I can —"

h "Just one day?"

d "Huh?"

show h neutralpaint
h "You want me to be yours for one day?"

show h angrypaint
h "What was all of that about being in love with me for years?"

h "Why settle for one day when you could..."

# Music change here, probably.

show h flirtyblushpaint
h "...y’know. Be with me forever. Or whatever."

d "I..."

show d surprisedblushpaint
d "I didn’t think of it like that."

show d smileblushpaint
d "That sounds like a great idea to me."

show h smileblushpaint
h "Good. Then, wear your best on Saturday."

h "You’re in for a date you’ll never forget, rival."

show h surprisedpaint
h "Right! Right. Well, I guess, uh..."

show h flirtyblushpaint
