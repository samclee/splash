# Story 1 | Epilogue - Lose

D (Huh.)
D (Didn’t think I’d actually lose to him… especially because I was actually trying.)
H Davonte.
D Eh?
D Did you just say my name?
H What? Of course I did.
H Why wouldn’t I?
D You haven’t said my name all day.
H Well, you haven’t said my name all day.
H So… I guess we’re even. Or whatever.
D Yeah. You’re right, Hao Yu.
D So? Did you come over here to gloat?
H N-no! I mean, I wanted to, but…
H …
H You played really well today, Davonte. I just wanted to let you know that…
H …as your rival and all.
D Rival, huh? You’re still sticking to that old story?
H Story? Oh, come on. We’re obviously rivals.
D No way, Hao Yu. We’re friends, and you know it.
H Ha! Friends? I went to a different university just so we could face off like this, you know.
D My point is, I’ve always wanted to follow your lead.
D Whatever you wanted me to do, I would do it.
D I played arcade fighters because you wanted to get better at them.
H And I did! I always kick your ass with Zero May Cry.
D We ran a marathon in L.A. because you felt like challenging yourself.
H And I did! Who crossed the finish line first? This guy.
D And you made me learn paint dodgeball because you thought it would be fun and competitive.
H And it is! We’ve faced off in the damn finals for the past four years.
H We wrecked the competition on our way to the top. Doesn’t that feel good?
D Well, sure. But I think I’ve had a lot more fun doing those things with you.
H Yeah? You think so?
D Come on. Imagine doing any of those things without me by your side.
H …
H …
H I guess you’re right. Winning without a rival would be… empty.
D Did you just realize that now? You’ve been going on and on about me being your rival for years.
H Oh, shut up. You know I realize things late.
H …
H Ah, shit.
D What? Did you reach a sudden revelation?
D ‘Cause I’m all ears.
H Damn you, Thompson.
H I know what I want you to do for me.
D That’s a scary face you’re making.
H Davonte. You and me. Downtown, at the arcade. Saturday.
D Uh… okay. Are we going a few rounds?
H Yup. Of course we are. Bring your A-game.
D You’re awfully calm about all of this…
H Let’s just say I’ve got a lot of shit to tell you, and I’m not the kinda guy who’s good with words.
H I’d rather show you. Makes sense?
D (Oh. I see what’s going on here.)
D Not really. Mind telling me what you’re thinking?
H Fuck, dude. I just told you that I’m not good with words.
D Words aren’t the only way -
H - to tell a person how you feel.
Music
H Why do you think I’m asking you out on a date?
H Because I’m not good with words. You’re just gonna have to wait for my confession. Or whatever.
D Confession, huh? What are you going to confess?
D That you’re secretly a cat?
H What? No.
D Then… maybe you’ll confess that you’re in love with me?
H …
H I told you to wait for it, Davonte. God, you’re stupid.
H And you think I’m the stupid one.
H You just ruined my whole surprise and everything!
D To be fair, it wasn’t that much of a surprise. Try again.
H Gah! You’re so annoying!
H Damn it, Davonte. You already know the drill, but I just…
H ...might feel things for you. Got it? It’s just a possibility.
H We’re just hanging out on Saturday. As rivals.
H Nothing more, nothing less.
D Aw! It’s almost like you care about me!
H What? I don’t care about you! Idiot!
H I just said that I might feel things for you! I didn’t say “care” or any other of your weird-ass words!
D Well, if it’s any consolation, I love you, Hao Yu. I know it doesn’t mean much -
H What.
D - but I hope you take it to heart.

H What? Don’t just say that, then walk away, asshole!
H Get back here right now!
H Say that to my face again! I command you! I won fair and square!
