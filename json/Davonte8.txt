h "Davonte."

d "Did you just say my name?"

show h surprisedpaint
h "What? Of course I did. Why wouldn't I?"

show d neutralpaint
d "You haven't said my name all day."

show h angrypaint
h "Well, [i]you[/i] haven't said [i]my[/i] name all day."

show h neutralpaint
h "So... I guess we're even. Or whatever."

show d smilepaint
d "Yeah. You're right, [i]Hao Yu[/i]."

show d neutralpaint
d "So? Did you come over here to gloat?"

show h surprisedpaint
h "N-no! I mean, I wanted to, but..."

show h neutralblushpaint
h "..."

h "You played really well today, Davonte. I just wanted to let you know that..."

show h angryblushpaint
h "...as your [i]rival[/i] and all."

show d smilepaint
d "Rival, huh? You're still sticking to that old story?"

show h angrypaint
h "Story? Oh, come on. We're obviously rivals."

d "No way, Hao Yu. We're friends, and you know it."

show h smilepaint
h "Ha! Friends? I went to a different university just so we could face off like this, you know."

d "Of course. Whatever you wanted me to do, I would do it."

show d neutralpaint
d "I played arcade fighters because you wanted to get better at them."

h "And I did! I always kick your ass with Zero May Cry."

show d smilepaint
d "We ran a marathon in L.A. because you felt like challenging yourself."

h "And I did! Who crossed the finish line first? This guy."

show d flirtypaint
d "And you made me learn paint dodgeball because you thought it would be fun and competitive."

h "And it is! We've faced off in the damn [i]finals[/i] for the past few years."

h "We wrecked the competition on our way to the top. Doesn't that feel good?"

show d smilepaint
d "Well, sure. But I think I've had a lot more fun doing those things with you."

show h neutralpaint
h "Yeah? You think so?"

d "Come on. Imagine doing any of those things without me by your side."

show h surprisedpaint
h "..."

show h neutralblushpaint
h "..."

show h smileblushpaint
h "I guess you're right. Winning without a rival would be... empty."

d "Did you just realize that [i]now[/i]? You've been going on and on about me being your rival for [i]years[/i]."

show h angryblushpaint
h "Oh, shut up. You know I realize things late."

show h surprisedblushpaint
h "..."

h "Ah, shit."

d "What? Did you reach a sudden revelation?"

d "'Cause I'm all ears."

show h angryblushpaint
h "Damn you, Thompson."

h "I know what I want you to do for me."

show d surprisedpaint
d "That's a scary face you're making."

show h neutralblushpaint
h "Davonte. You and me. Downtown, at the arcade. Saturday."

d "Uh... okay. Are we going a few rounds?"

show h smileblushpaint
h "Let's just say I've got a lot of shit to tell you, and I'd rather show you. Make sense?"

show d smilepaint
d "(He's not exactly being subtle about all this, but I'll play along.)"

show d neutralpaint
d "I think I get what you're putting down."

show d smilepaint
d "Words aren't the only way -"

show h neutralblushpaint
h "- to tell a person how you feel. Yep."

h "Why do you think I'm asking you out on a date?"

show h flirtyblushpaint
h "Because I'm not good with words. You're just gonna have to wait for my confession... or whatever."

show d flirtyblushpaint
d "Confession, huh? What are you going to confess?"

show d smileblushpaint
d "That you're secretly a cat?"

show h surprisedblushpaint
h "What? No."

d "Then... maybe you'll confess that you're in love with me?"

h "..."

show h angryblushpaint
h "I told you to [i]wait[/i] for it, Davonte. God, you're stupid."

h "And you think [i]I'm[/i] the stupid one. You just ruined my whole surprise and everything!"

d "To be fair, it wasn't that much of a surprise. Try again."

h "Gah! You're so annoying!"

h "Damn it, Davonte. You already know the drill, but I just..."

h "...might feel things for you. Got it? It's just a possibility."

h "We're just hanging out on Saturday. As [i]rivals[/i]."

h "Nothing more, nothing less."

d "Aw! It's almost like you care about me!"

h "What? I don't care about you! Idiot!"

h "I just said that I [i]might[/i] feel [i]things[/i] for you! I didn't say “care” or any other of your weird-ass words!"

d "Well, if it's any consolation, [i]I[/i] love you, Hao Yu. I know it doesn't mean much -"

h What.

d "- but I hope you take it to heart. See you Saturday."
