h "(Finally... It’s over.)"

h "Well? How’s that for a dominating win, Davonte?"

h "What do you think?"

d "Nothing, really."

d "I didn’t think much of it."

h "..."

h "Seriously?"

h "Even after I wont, you still think you can talk down to me like I’m nothing?"

d "...What are you talking about?"

h "You still wanna pick a fight with me? Huh?"

d "When I said, “Nothing,” I meant that I’m not surprised you won."

d "I’ve been trying to tell you this all day. You’re an incredible guy."

h "What."

d "Seriously! You’ve always been such a badass dude, and I’m proud I know you."

d "You always face obstacles head-on, and I admire that about. To be honest, I —"

h "Shut up! Shut up, shut up, shut up!"
h "I... can’t believe you think of me like that!"

h "What the hell, dude?"

d "Did I misunderstand something?"

h "All day, you’ve been taunting me, saying shit like, “We’re not equals” and “Say something useful next time.”"

d "What? I never said any of that."

h "Yes, you did! You totally did."

d "What? No way. You must have misunderstood me."

h "Hell no! Your words made no sense, dude!"

d "How could you say that? My word choice is absolutely..."

d "...fleeting."

h "What?"

h "What the hell does that even mean?"

d "Hakanai… You know what? It doesn’t matter."

d "Did you really think we were rivals?"

h "Of course! We’ve known each other since forever."

h "And I’ve wanted to one-up you for years."

h "But you’ve always been better than me."

h "You’ve always been out of reach."

d "Well..."

d "I’m right here now, aren’t I?"

h "I guess you’re right..."

d "And you get to order me around for a day because you won."

h "Yeah. Yeah! You know what? You’re right!"

d "Oh? Jeez, what lit a fire under you?"

h "Well, I just… I might… There’s a possibility that I feel..."

h "...something. For you."

d "Really now?"

h "..."

d "I guess I shouldn’t have expected —"

h "Davonte, I’m in love with you."

h "And I have been. For a long time."

d "Hao Yu..."

h "I don’t... you know. I don’t words as well as you do."

h "You got all these fancy words and different languages and big brain shit."

h "Me? I don’t really have anything to offer."

d "Don’t put yourself down like that. You beat me fair and square, remember?"

h "..."

h "..."

h "Tell the whole world we’re rivals, rival. Right now."

d "Is that all? Easy."

d "We’re rivals."

h "..."

h "...?"

h "What the hell was that? You just whispered in my ear."

d "Because you’re my whole world, rival."

h "..."

h "WHAT?"

h "WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?"

h "GET BACK HERE, DAVONTE!"

h "YOU DIDN’T ACTUALLY LISTEN TO MY REQUEST!"

d "Sorry, what was that?"

d "I can’t hear you over the sound of our height difference."

h "Get back here!"

h "I’m changing my request — you have to make me dinner!"

h "No, wait — take me to Disneyland and ride all the rides with me, you dick!"

h "We’re going on “It’s a Small World” five times!"

h "Then make me dinner! No, scratch that! Make me meals for the entire day!"

h "You owe me for winning, you asshoooooooooooole!"
