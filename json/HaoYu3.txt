h "(Hah?)"

h "(I won? There’s no way — he shouldn’t have made it this easy!)"

h "(He’s the second best paint dodgeball player in the entire country!)"

d "You’re pretty good at this, aren’t you, buddy?"

h "Oh, quit slacking, you liar!"

d "What are you talking about?"

h "I know you let me win, rival."

h "I want to battle you at your best, not take your damn scraps."

h "Don’t treat me like I’m stupid."

d "Okay, okay. You caught me. I just wanted to make things interesting."

d "Besides, how’d you know I wasn’t trying my hardest?

d "Have you been paying close attention to me?"

h "What? Of course not! I just know you’re better than this, and you’d better show it!"

d "Whoa, is the little fish actually complimenting me? I never thought I’d see the day."

h "I’m not giving you a compliment!"

h "And quit calling me “little fish.” That’s not what the characters of my name mean."

d "Of course I know that. No one in their right mind would name themselves “good fish.”"

d "Plus, I’m the one who picked out the right characters for you."

h "Yeah? Well, fuck you."

h "..."

d "..."

h "And, you know… thanks for helping me with the characters or whatever."

d "That’s all I wanted to hear."

d "You’re welcome."

h "(Damn bastard.)"

h "(I hate how good he is at everything, but I swear he won’t beat me!)"

h "I haven’t trained this hard at paint dodgeball for nothing!)"
