h "(Damn it! How could I lose?)"

h "I guess that’s it, huh?"

d "You’re not going to get mad that you lost?"

h "Hell no. Why would I do that?"

h "You won fair and square."

h "Do what you wish."

d "Then listen closely."

h "Okay, okay. You don’t have to tell me twice."

d "I’m in love with you."

d "To clarify, I’ve been in love with you… for years now."

h "What."

d "Seriously. Ever since we were kids, I’ve always admired you."

d "You were so cool and strong, and you never —"

h "Hold up. This is me you’re talking about, right?"

h "Because it legit sounds like you’re talking about someone else."

d "I need you to take me seriously."

d "This isn’t a joke, Hao Yu."

h "Finally!"

h "God, do you know how long I’ve been waiting for you to say my name?"

d "Huh?"

h "You haven’t said my name all day, asshole."

h "You kept going on about “buddy” and “friend” and “pal” like we’re just two dudes in a hot tub sitting six feet apart from each other."

h "If you’re in love with me, then you’d better say my damn name, idiot."

d "Me? I’m the idiot?"

d "You haven’t said my name the entire day either!"

h "Oh, you noticed? Good. Then we’re even, Davonte!"

d "No, we’re not! I’ve been trying to flirt with you all day, and you’ve done nothing but reject my advances."

d "Are my words not fleeting enough for you?"

h "Fleeting — what the hell are you talking about?"

d "You know, like… hakanai? Fleeting?"

h "What?"

h "(Man, Davonte likes such obscure anime. I don’t get it.)"

h "Jeez, dude, you just ruined the mood."

d "Well, excuse me, Hao Yu. I’m not the person who gets all tsundere when a guy compliments me."

h "Hey! I am always a tsundere, thank you very much."

h "Don’t flatter yourself. It’s not like I only act this way around you."

d "Uh-huh."

d "I’d believe that if you weren’t confessing your undying love to me right now."

h "Oh, you are unbelievable!"
h "I can’t believe I fell in love with an idiot like you!"

h "I’m going home."

d "Wait, wait. What did you just say?"

h "I’m going home?"

d "No, before that."

h "You’re unbelievable."

d "In between those two sentences."

h "..."
h "I can’t believe I fell in love with an idiot like you? (small text)"

d "Yeah, that one!"

d "I think I know what my little request is going to be."

h "Oh, damn it."

d "Tell me you’re in love with me."

h "What?"

d "I mean, unless it’s not true, of course."

h "Grr..."

h "Davonte, I’m in love with you."

d "Wow. I never thought I’d hear you say that."

d "Say it again."

h "I’m in love with you."

d "One more time."

h "Seriously?"

d "One more time!"

h "Ugh. Fine."

h "I’m in love with you."

d "Okay, now —"

h "If you make me say it again, I’m punching you."

d "Okay, okay. I hear you loud and clear."

d "This weekend, I want you to take me out on a date. Okay? Plan it from start to finish."

d "I want to be wowed by you, little fish."

h "Quit calling me that."

d "Oh, and I get to call you little fish until our date is over."

h "Fine. Anything else?"

d "A kiss would be nice."

h "Hell no."

d "Aww. You were listening to my requests so well up until now."

h "..."

h "You’re supposed to save the kiss for after the date."

h "So, just wait till then, okay?"

d "Really?"

h "Really."

d "Okay. I’ll hold you to it, rival."

h "I wouldn’t want it any other way."
