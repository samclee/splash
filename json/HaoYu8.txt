h "I guess that's it, huh?"

show d surprisedpaint
d "You're not mad that you lost?"

show h surprisedpaint
h "Hell no. Why would I be?"

show h neutralpaint
h "You won fair and square."

h "Do what you wish."

show d neutralpaint
d "...Are you sure? You're being oddly reasonable."

show h angrypaint
h "Hey! I can be perfectly reasonable and trustworthy!"

show d surprisedpaint
d "Well, whatever you say."

show d smilepaint
d "Listen closely."

show h neutralpaint
h "Okay, okay. You don't have to tell me twice."

d "I'm in love with you."

show h surprisedblushpaint
h "What?"

d "To clarify, I've [i]been[/i] in love with you... for years now."

show h angryblushpaint
h "What."

show d smileblushpaint
d "Seriously. Ever since we were kids, I've always admired you."

d "You were so cool and strong, and you never —"

show h surprisedblushpaint
h "Hold up. This is me you're talking about, right?"

h "Because it legit sounds like you're talking about someone else."

show d angryblushpaint
d "I need you to take me seriously."

d "This isn't a joke, Hao Yu."

show h neutralblushpaint
h "Finally!"

show h smileblushpaint
h "God, do you know how long I've been waiting for you to say my [i]name[/i]?"

show d surprisedpaint
d "Huh?"

h "You haven't said my name [i]all day[/i], asshole."

show h neutralblushpaint
h "You kept going on about “buddy” and “friend” and “pal” like we're just two dudes in a hot tub sitting six feet apart from each other."

show h angryblushpaint
h "If you're in love with me, then you'd better say my damn name, [i]idiot[/i]."

show d neutralblushpaint
d "Me? [i]I'm[/i] the idiot?"

show d angryblushpaint
d "You haven't said my name the entire day either!"

show h smilepaint
h "Oh, you noticed? Good. Then we're even, [i]Davonte[/i]!"

show d neutralpaint
d "No, we're not! I've been trying to flirt with you all day, and you've done nothing but reject my advances."

show d flirtypaint
d "Are my words not fleeting enough for you?"

show h surprisedpaint
h "Fleeting — what the hell are you talking about?"

show d flirtyblushpaint
d "You know, like… [i]hakanai[/i]? Fleeting?"

h "What?"

show h neutralpaint
h "(Man, Davonte likes such obscure anime. I don't get it.)"

h "Jeez, dude, you just ruined the mood."

show d neutralblushpaint
d "Well, [i]excuse me[/i], Hao Yu. I'm not the person who gets all tsundere when a guy compliments me."

show h angryblushpaint
h "Hey! I am [i]always[/i] a tsundere, thank you very much."

show h neutralblushpaint
h "Don't flatter yourself. It's not like I only act this way around you."

show d smilepaint
d "Uh-huh."

d "I'd believe that if you weren't confessing your undying love to me right now."

h "Oh, you are [i]unbelievable[/i]!"

show h angryblushpaint
h "I can't believe I fell in love with an idiot like you!"

h "I'm going home."
